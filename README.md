# Biosignal-to-biosignal-mapping-

Code for learning a mapping between a segment of source biosignals and a target biosignal segment. The mapping is represented as a neural network, using the UNet architecture commonly encountered in computer vision for image segmentation. This method can be used for example to map biosignal acquired from a wearable device to a more informative biosignal that cannot be acquired using wearable sensors.
