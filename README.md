# Biosignal-to-biosignal-mapping-

Code for learning a mapping between a number of source biosignals and a target biosignal. The mapping is represented using a neural network (using the UNet architecture commonly encountered in computer vision). This method can be used, for example to map biosignals acquired from a wearable device to a more informative biosignal that cannot be acquired using wearable sensors. The neural network architecture is implemented in PyTorch.
